# **Louis **

**Louis** is a gulp task that is used to analyze the performance of a website against a performance budget.


## Introduction

There are many definitions of the **performance budget** on the web, my favourite is from Zachary Brady.

***A performance budget provides values against which design, development, content, or any aspect of a site that may affect performance, can be made.***

The aim of the plugin is to analyze the performance of the website against a performance bugdet. There are various metrics against which we can set a performance budget e.g. number of requests, imageSize etc.
